## 🧠 Problem-Solving Framework

### 1. **Learn → Apply**

* Learn topic-wise.
* Solve assignment problems immediately after watching videos.

### 2. **How to Practice DSA Effectively**

* Complete assignments after every lecture.
* Daily practice on [LeetCode Topicwise]([Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/)) .
* Use the **Problem List + Thumbs Up** to prioritize:
  * Easy → Medium → Popular Hard
  * *Don’t worry about Hard Q’s just do the Popular hard Q’s.*
  * Focus on problems with many 👍
* Don’t spend more than **30 mins** on a problem:
    * Try again after 10–15 min.
* Use Hint/Discussion.
* Still stuck? See the solution.
* Bookmark and revisit difficult questions after 2 weeks or 1 month.
> Make Note for each Topic “Every topic try to see what type of pattern are being Used to solve which type of Problem” OR “Each topic try to see which type problem is solved via which type of pattern and how that is optimize”.

**🔑 Understanding which type Algorithm to apply for which type of Problem**

## 🧠 Problem-Solving Framework
![![DSA Topicwise](https://neetcode.io/roadmap)](./DSA%20Order.png)
* Start with **Brute Force(simple solution)**
    * Try to **Optimize it**.
    * Try to find Patterns of Similar Q solved before & which Algorithm is used to Solved it.
    * Make a Note "What type of Problem use which type of Algorithm & how to optimize it."
* Note down **Patterns** for each *Topic*:
  * Type of problem
  * Which algorithm/pattern was used
  * How to Optimize it.
* Doing questions **topic-wise** helps to identify patterns.

> ⚠️ **Patterns matter more than memorizing questions.**
> 💡 Medium questions = Apply the right known algorithm  
> 🔐 Hard questions = Same pattern, but trickier

---

## 📝 Note-Taking Strategy

* Maintain topic-wise notes:
  * List patterns(algo) for each type of question.
  * Write different approaches with pros/cons.
* Revisit notes regularly to reinforce understanding.

---

## 🔄 Review & Repetition

* Regular Reviewing of *Notes* & *Patterns* every week.
* Try NeetCode quizzes to reinforce logic faster.
* Review and solve bookmarked problems weekly/monthly.

## 💡 Interview Preparation Tips

🧠 [DSA Practice Tips](https://youtu.be/ddI_rCCtwkI?si=oHZA9v4jfXUl51o3)

* Be **interview-ready** always:
* Solve 1–2 hours of quality problems daily (ideally in the morning).
* Avoid blind problem-solving or DSA Sheets.
* Focus on Fundamentals **Core 45 Skills** & **Blind 75** able to do without much things(muscle memory).
* The Core 45 Q’s should be as easy for you as writing abc within 5 min.(It take 5 Repetition within a Month to reach 5 min to apply and learn the Core Topics )(Be really good at Core Topic)
* **Interview Ready** Rule of Thumb is you should able to solve a Medium Problem that you never seen before within 20 to 25 min.

> 💪 Quality > Quantity. 250 well-understood problems >> Random 1000.
#### First complete the Core Skills —> Blind 75 —> Neetcode 150 --> Neetcode 250.
> **By Solving Neetcode 250 question you will able to Learn 99% of Pattern use to solve a New Question.**
>Focus on Learning the ALL Pattern with different variance of Q —> It help in Interview as you already solve the similar Q before

## 🧭 Final Thoughts

> “You’ll never feel 100% ready. Show up consistently and stay sharp.”

- Aim high: FAANG or startups — both require strong problem-solving.
- Balance DSA with:
  - 🔨 Development
  - 🌐 Open Source
  - 🤝 Networking
