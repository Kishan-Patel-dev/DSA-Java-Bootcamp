# 🚀 My Java + DSA + OOPs Journey (Kunal Kushwaha's Bootcamp)

<div align="center">

![DSA Journey](https://readme-typing-svg.herokuapp.com?font=Fira+Code&weight=500&size=40&pause=1000&color=2E9BF7&center=true&vCenter=true&random=false&width=600&height=100&lines=Mastering+DSA;Problem+Solving+Skills;Crack+Interviews;with+Kishan)

Welcome to my learning-in-public journey where I tackle Data Structures & Algorithms with Java, following Kunal Kushwaha's DSA Bootcamp and curated resources from the community.

> "DSA is your backup. Development is your mission." – This repo is where backup meets execution.
> "Around 80% Companies still ask DSA in their Interview Process"

## 🧠 Core Learning Strategy

- 🚦 Learn → Apply → Review → Repeat
- ⏳ 30-Minute Rule: If stuck, move on after 30 mins. Revisit with fresh eyes.
- 🔁 Spaced Repetition: Re-solve bookmarked problems after 2 weeks.
- 📈 Focus on Patterns: Brute Force → Optimize → Note the Algorithm/Approach
